This is simple project aimed to create "build indicator" using Python and Arduino.

Build indicator in this case is two RGB LEDs which are controlled by Arduino sketch, which 
in turn is controlled by python script from host PC. 

Indicator can show three states:
 - build successful - both LEDs are shining green
 - build in progress - LEDs are smoothly fading in and out yellow
 - build failed - LEDs are flashing red and blue like police strobes

 Actually whole stuff is intended to be mounted on a model car with diodes acting as beacons.
